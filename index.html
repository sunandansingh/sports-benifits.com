    Swimming is a low-impact exercise that can be done no matter one’s current fitness ability or age. Because of this, it is beneficial for those who may have injuries and need rehabilitation as well as those looking to keep fit and young. Following are 5 major benefits of swimming:
    
    One of the greatest benefits of swimming is that it can be done by nearly everyone. Because there are no high-impact motions involved, those who are recovering from joint injuries or age-related problems such as arthritis can participate in swimming without exacerbating these conditions. This makes it a good workout option for seniors and rehabilitation purposes for younger populations.
    Swimming can be done at any fitness level, making it an exercise accessible to nearly everyone. This is because there are many ways to swim – one can choose whether they want to use their arms or legs more, for example, or simply stick with a style that works best for them. For those who are not physically fit, swimming is a low-risk workout option, allowing them to slowly improve their health and fitness level.
    Because water offers resistance, swimming strengthens the muscles one uses when they are in the pool. Many swimmers also do weight training outside of the pool to build muscle mass and increase strength even further. As muscles are built, fat is burned, providing even more incentive for people to get in the pool.
    Swimming is a cardio exercise that can help improve cardiovascular health and overall endurance while also strengthening muscles needed for other activities where high-impact motions may be involved, such as running or jumping sports. Regular aerobic exercise, such as swimming, has been shown to reduce the risk of disease by lowering blood pressure, cholesterol levels and body fat. This makes swimming beneficial for those with medical conditions that are worsened by these factors, such as heart disease or obesity.
    Finally, swimming is a low-impact workout that can be done by nearly everyone, making it beneficial for those with joint issues or other medical conditions that restrict their ability to do high-impact exercises. Since swimming reduces the risk of injury later in life while still providing many other benefits, people may want to consider adding this activity into their lifestyle if they want to improve their overall wellness and decrease the risk of developing medical conditions in the future.</b></p>
